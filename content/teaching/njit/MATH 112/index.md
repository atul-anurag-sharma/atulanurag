## Course Description

From Fall 2019 to Spring 2022, I served as a Recitation Leader for **Calculus II (Math 112)**, an undergraduate-level course covering advanced topics in integral calculus, sequences and series, and polar coordinates.

My worked solutions to previous exams can be found here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [**Calculus II Exam Solutions**](CalculusII.pdf)

Each week, I also curated and assigned targeted **practice problem sets**, designed to reinforce key concepts and support exam preparation.
