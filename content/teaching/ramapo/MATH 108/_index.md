## Course Description

This course introduces students to both **descriptive** and **inferential statistics**, with a foundation in **elementary probability**. Key topics include:

- Organizing and describing data
- Measures of center and variation
- Probability rules and distributions
- Binomial and normal distributions
- Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing
- Correlation and linear regression

Students will explore real-life data sets through a variety of exercises, gaining hands-on experience with both mathematical methods and graphing calculator tools.

This course is part of the **General Education Program** in the **Quantitative Reasoning** category and is designed to be accessible and applicable to students from across disciplines.

---

## Course Goals

- Understand and apply the **three-step process of statistics**: data collection, analysis, and inference.
- Explore **probability** both as a mathematical discipline and as a foundation for statistics.
- Solve problems **algebraically** and using **graphing calculator technology**.
- Improve **problem-solving** and **critical thinking skills** through applied examples.

---

## Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Solve problems reflecting core statistical and probabilistic concepts.
2. Perform computations by hand and using a graphing calculator.
3. Communicate mathematical reasoning clearly and effectively.

**Assessment:** These outcomes are assessed through quizzes, assignments, midterm exams, and a cumulative final exam.
