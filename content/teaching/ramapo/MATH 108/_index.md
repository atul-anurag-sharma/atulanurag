## Course Description

Math 108 is an introductory course in probability and statistics, designed for students across diverse fields who seek a foundational understanding of data and uncertainty. The course provides tools to interpret, describe, and make inferences from data in real-world contexts.

Topics include:

- Descriptive statistics: measures of central tendency and variability
- Data visualization: histograms, boxplots, scatterplots
- Probability theory: basic rules, conditional probability, and independence
- Discrete and continuous probability distributions
- Sampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem
- Estimation and hypothesis testing
- Correlation and regression analysis

Emphasis is placed on conceptual understanding, interpretation of results, and statistical reasoning over calculation. This course is suitable for students with minimal mathematical background but who are comfortable with basic algebra.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Summarize and interpret data using graphical and numerical methods
- Apply probability rules and distributions to real-world problems
- Conduct hypothesis tests and construct confidence intervals
- Analyze relationships between variables using correlation and regression
- Critically evaluate statistical claims in media, research, and public discourse
