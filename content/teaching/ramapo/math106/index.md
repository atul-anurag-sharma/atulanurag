# Course title, summary, and position.
title: Math 106 Introduction to Mathematical Modeling
linktitle: Math
summary: This Quantitative Reasoning course is designed for non-science majors who want to see how math connects to everyday life. Youâ€™ll build problem-solving and reasoning skills by exploring real-world applications in areas like business decisions, voting systems, and population studies. Topics include project scheduling, linear programming, how voting systems can be fair (or not), ways to divide resources fairly, and how to detect or fix data errors. By the end of the course, youâ€™ll see how math helps explain and solve real problems in the world around you.

## Course Description
This is a Quantitative Reasoning keystone course meant for non-science majors. The course is intended to provide insight into the importance of mathematics to the world outside academia, and to improve students reasoning and problemâ€”solving skills. It will introduce to students applications by way of management decision making, social choice, and population studies. Typical among problems to be studied are: scheduling of projects with precedence restrictions; linear Programming problems; manipulability of voting systems; weighted voting systems (coalitions and relative power, paradoxes in voting systems); apportionment; fair division in presence of individual preferences; detection and or
correction of data transmission errors.
