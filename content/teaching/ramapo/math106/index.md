## Course Description
This is a Quantitative Reasoning keystone course meant for non-science majors. The course is intended to provide insight into the importance of mathematics to the world outside academia, and to improve students reasoning and problemâ€”solving skills. It will introduce to students applications by way of management decision making, social choice, and population studies. Typical among problems to be studied are: scheduling of projects with precedence restrictions; linear Programming problems; manipulability of voting systems; weighted voting systems (coalitions and relative power, paradoxes in voting systems); apportionment; fair division in presence of individual preferences; detection and or
correction of data transmission errors.
