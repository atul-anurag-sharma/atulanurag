## Course Description

This introduction to statistics consists of both descriptive and inferential statistics, offering elementary probability as its background. Topics include: organization and description of data, introduction to probability, probability distributions, making inferences about population parameters using hypothesis testing, correlation and linear regression. The course offers a variety of exercises with real-life data sets. 

The course is designed to introduce the student to the language, methodology, scope, and spirit of mathematics through an introduction to probability and statistics, two topics which are rich in applications and can genuinely be appreciated by students throughout the College.
