---
When you realize that letting go is better than holding, Love Resurrects.

When you realize that presence is not important to be part of something, Love Resurrects.

When you realize that you are being unconditionally attached, Love Resurrects.

When you realize that you have no longings for yourself, Love Resurrects.

When you realize learning from life is fathomless, Love Resurrects.

When you realize that you are commemorating your enemy's success, Love Resurrects.

When you realize that you have started accepting rather than expecting, Love Resurrects.

When you realize that you are mortal and today is the only day to live, Love Resurrects.

When you realize that nothing remains constant in life, Love Resurrects.
