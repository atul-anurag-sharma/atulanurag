title: "Since Then!"
---
Since then, the breath flowing with the winds continued but the heartbeat was lost somewhere.<br/>

Since then, there was a wave of happiness in my mind but my thoughts got lost somewhere.<br/>

Since then, many new paths have been found but the destination has been lost somewhere.<br/>

Since then, many pleasant nights have come but the sleep of your dreams has been lost somewhere.<br/>

Since then, I have remembered many memories but the desire to meet has been lost somewhere.<br/>

Since then, I have had many dreams but the desire to win has been lost somewhere.<br/>

Since then, days passed but the pace of time got lost somewhere.<br/>

<p align="center"><b>O Friend!</b></p>
O friend! Let’s not worry about tomorrow,<br/>
We have this moment to live, let’s not hurry.<br/>

O friend! Let’s follow the ray of hope in the infinite darkness of fear,<br/>
I am shining in the vicinity of you, who cares.<br/>

O friend! Let’s not hold onto the grievances of pain,<br/>
Hold my hand and enhance your personal gains.<br/>

O friend! Let’s paint our future desires bold,<br/>
Listen to the rhythm of life, the music that never grows old.<br/>

<p align="center"><b>You Are.</b></p>

You are love. The quality of air I breathe.<br/>

You are love. The wings with which life flies without interference.<br/>

You are love. The time that I live without passing.<br/>

You are love. The sea that flows without knowing the path of an ocean.<br/>

You are love. The path I walk on when astray.<br/>

You are love. The strength to the heart that beats.<br/>

You are love. The comfort in moments of despair.<br/>

You are love. The option I choose in confusion.<br/>

You are love. The habit I follow, not the hobby I change.<br/>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<div class="blue">
    <p>Neither am I anyone special, nor am I close to anyone,<br>
    I am the belief that you cannot imagine,<br>
    I am the feeling that you cannot attain,<br>
    I am a flight without wings,<br>
    I am an action without work,<br>
    I am absorbed in front of the eyes,<br>
    I am the next moment of tomorrow's life.<br><br>
    Now, there's a fear of taking new turns even on easy paths of life,<br>
    There's a fear of being unknown even after meeting familiar people,<br>
    There's a fear of raining sorrows after clouds of happiness,<br>
    There's a fear of losing even this confident mind filled with success,<br>
    Hopes have drowned in the ocean of doubts, now even being or not being feels pointless.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
    <p>When the night takes the circles of darkness,<br>
    Your moon-like face wraps a sheet of light of madness.<br>
    You come to wake me up from my sleep, bringing the rays of the sun,<br>
    From the ground to the sky, you are the one.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
    <p>For when friendship is with the light,<br>
    There is no fear of taking a dark flight.<br>
    So let's get lost somewhere on this black night,<br>
    And cherish each other's company until the first light.</p>
</div>
