title: "Since Then!"
---
Since then, the breath flowing with the winds continued but the heartbeat was lost somewhere.<br/>

Since then, there was a wave of happiness in my mind but my thoughts got lost somewhere.<br/>

Since then, many new paths have been found but the destination has been lost somewhere.<br/>

Since then, many pleasant nights have come but the sleep of your dreams has been lost somewhere.<br/>

Since then, I have remembered many memories but the desire to meet has been lost somewhere.<br/>

Since then, I have had many dreams but the desire to win has been lost somewhere.<br/>

Since then, days passed but the pace of time got lost somewhere.<br/>

<p align="center"><b>O Friend!</b></p>
O friend! Let’s not worry about tomorrow,<br/>
We have this moment to live, let’s not hurry.<br/>

O friend! Let’s follow the ray of hope in the infinite darkness of fear,<br/>
I am shining in the vicinity of you, who cares.<br/>

O friend! Let’s not hold onto the grievances of pain,<br/>
Hold my hand and enhance your personal gains.<br/>

O friend! Let’s paint our future desires bold,<br/>
Listen to the rhythm of life, the music that never grows old.<br/>

<p align="center"><b>You Are.</b></p>
YOU ARE LOVE. THE QUALITY OF AIR I BREATHE.<br/>
YOU ARE LOVE. THE WINGS WITH WHICH LIFE FLIES WITHOUT INTERFERENCE.<br/>
YOU ARE LOVE. THE TIME THAT I LIVE WITHOUT PASSING.<br/>
YOU ARE LOVE. THE SEA THAT FLOWS WITHOUT KNOWING THE PATH OF AN OCEAN.<br/>
YOU ARE LOVE. THE REASON FOR MY AWARENESS IN MY FEARS. YOU ARE LOVE. THE PATH I WALK ON WHEN ASTRAY.<br/>
YOU ARE LOVE. THE STRENGTH TO THE HEART THAT BEATS.<br/>
YOU ARE LOVE. THE COMFORT IN MOMENTS OF DESPAIR.<br/>
YOU ARE LOVE. THE OPTION I CHOOSE IN CONFUSION.<br/>
YOU ARE LOVE. THE HABIT I FOLLOW, NOT THE HOBBY I CHANGE.
