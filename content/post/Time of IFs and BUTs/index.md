<p align="center"><b>TIME</b></p>
Time comes as a smile on your face, Time brings sorrow to your life, Time causes confusion,<br />
Time teaches you how to live,<br />
The spinning wheel of time never stops for anyone.<br />
If you are happy, then time is good,<br />
If you are sad, then time is bad,<br />
Time has many names, but it moves at its own pace for everyone, Respect time or not, time never stops for anyone.<br />
Time does not stop for those who want to live,<br />
Time does not stop for those who are tired of life,<br />
Time is life, and time is death,<br />
Time moves according to its own will,<br />
This is the spinning wheel of time, which never stops for anyone.
