<p align="center"><b>TIME</b></p>
Time comes as a smile on your face, Time brings sorrow to your life, Time causes confusion,
Time teaches you how to live,
The spinning wheel of time never stops for anyone.<br />
If you are happy, then time is good,
If you are sad, then time is bad,
Time has many names, but it moves at its own pace for everyone, Respect time or not, time never stops for anyone.<br />
Time does not stop for those who want to live,
Time does not stop for those who are tired of life,
Time is life, and time is death,
Time moves according to its own will,
This is the spinning wheel of time, which never stops for anyone.
