<p align="center"><b>TIME</b></p>
Time comes as a smile on your face, Time brings sorrow to your life, Time causes confusion,<br />
Time teaches you how to live,<br />
The spinning wheel of time never stops for anyone.<br />
If you are happy, then time is good,<br />
If you are sad, then time is bad,<br />
Time has many names, but it moves at its own pace for everyone, Respect time or not, time never stops for anyone.<br />
Time does not stop for those who want to live,<br />
Time does not stop for those who are tired of life,<br />
Time is life, and time is death,<br />
Time moves according to its own will,<br />
This is the spinning wheel of time, which never stops for anyone.
<p align="center"><b>IFs and BUTs</b></p>
If one morning while walking the path, I don't see you, I'll change the destination,<br />

If one night in a dream I don't catch a glimpse of you, I'll change the dream,<br />

If one day I don't smell your fragrance in the air, I'll change the direction of my breath,<br />

If one day, while remembering good times, I don't think of you, then I'll change the pace of time itself,<br />

If one day, while listening to a song, I don’t imagine the way you groove, then I’ll change the rhythm of the music.<br />

If one day, while reading a love story, I can't feel how passionately I love you, then I will change the definition of love.
