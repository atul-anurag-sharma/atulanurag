On November 22, 2022: I am turning twenty-eight.My birthday has no importance without quoting a Sanskrit Shloka,

सर्वतीर्थमयी माता सर्वदेवमयः पिता |

मातरं पितरं तस्मात् सर्वयत्नेन पूजयेत् ||

The gist of the Shloka is:

To a person, his mother is an object of veneration, and his father is like all the Gods combined. Therefore, his sacred duty is to revere and serve both of them with utmost care and attention.

I have had a sinusoidal year so far, with many ups and downs. This is a rarefied world. Like the outside world, personal identity is far away. I was crestfallen, and I was losing my identity. But my friends helped me sail my drowning lifeboat to reach its shore, and I will always be in their debt for the rest of my life.

Life is unsettling enough, but it is only the beginning. "Our life is shaped by our mind, for we become what we think".

I was born a tabula rasa, but my life experiences have helped me become the person I am today.

The life-changing quote in my life this year was by the great Chinese philosopher: Lao Tzu. The quote is:

**<div style="text-align:center;">**
**If you are depressed, you are living in the past.**  
**If you are anxious, you are living in the future.**  
**If you are at peace, you are living in the present.**  
**</div>**



Indeed, today I am at peace. I am only reminiscing the evanescence of life. I have petered out my pompousness. With my exquisite tenderness of mental awareness, I vow to open a door of ecstasy to everyone. I bow down in reverence to everyone and wish them the best year ahead. Thank you all for being part of my life.
