title: "How can I tell what you are to me?"
---
How can I tell what you are to me?

You brighten my mornings and soothe my nights,

You bring light to my days and warmth to my life.

You are the dew of the dawn, refreshing and new.

You are the summer sun, shining and true.

How can I tell what you are to me?

You give meaning to my existence,

You are my days filled with joy and persistence.

You are my prayers to the heavens above,

You are the peace that fills my heart with love.

How can I tell what you are to me?

Your smile brings brightness to my face,

Your grace shines like stars in the night's embrace.

You are the breath of life that sustains me,

You are the purpose that drives me endlessly.

How can I tell what you are to me?

You are the reason I smile, the reason I sing,

The reason my heart takes flight on joyful wings.

You are the one who makes my life complete,

The missing piece to my puzzle, oh my dear sweet.

You are the hand that lifts me up when I fall,

You are the voice that whispers in my ear,

The words of encouragement, the comfort I hold dear.

How can I tell what you are to me?

You are the stars that twinkle in the sky,

The music that fills my soul, the beat that never dies.

You are the laughter that echoes through the air,

The happiness that shines brighter than the sun up there.

How can I tell what you are to me?

You are the memories I cherish every day,

The moments we've shared, in a special way.

You are the beauty that surrounds me, the one I see,

The person who makes me feel so incredibly free.

How can I tell what you are to me?

You are the friend I turn to, through thick and thin,

The one who is always there, who knows where I've been.

You are the love I feel, the passion that's real,

The bond that connects us, the strength that we steal.

How can I tell what you are to me?

You are the sun that rises, the moon that shines,

The laughter that lifts me, the happiness that's mine.

You are the light that shines in the darkness, the truth that sets me free,

You are the reason I live, the reason I believe.

How can I tell what you are to me? <br />
How can I tell what you are to me?
