abstract: We investigate three problems in point-vortices dynamics within a two-dimensional, inviscid, incompressible fluid. We derive a new reduction of a system of three vortices. The integrable reduced system has an easily visualized phase plane that illuminates the dynamics.
We apply it to explain the scattering of the point-vortex dipole with a third vortex in two cases. We then add a fourth vortex and use the reduced dynamics of the three-vortex system as the basis for the perturbative study of dipole-dipole scattering.
