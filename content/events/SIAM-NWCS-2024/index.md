abstract:  The motion of three point-vortices in a 2D inviscid, incompressible fluid has been widely studied. Gröbli (1877) derived a closed system for the evolution of the side lengths of the triangle formed by the vortices. This system has been the basis of most studies of this problem.<br />These coordinates have a few disadvantages. First, the coordinates must satisfy the triangle inequality, so not all points in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ are physical. Second, the system introduced non-physical singularities because collinear arrangements lie on the boundary of the triangle inequality. Third, these coordinates break the useful Hamiltonian structure and make phase-plane reasoning difficult.<br /> We introduce a coordinate system for this problem that overcomes these disadvantages using a sequence of systematic and standard reductions. We first use Jacobi coordinates, a common technique in n-body systems, and further apply a Nambu Bracket reduction. The method avoids creating non-physical singularities and makes the system's phase-space geometry and topology plain.<br /> A previous Nambu-bracket formulation based on Gröbli's reduction inherited its triangle-inequality-related disadvantages. Depending on the circulations, the phase space may be a sphere or one sheet of a two-sheeted hyperboloid. Prior attempts to classify the dynamics focused solely on the stability of the relative fixed points; this approach allows us to explain the results more clearly using the entire phase space.
